A Casio Basic Project - Parser and Interpreter

This is my entry for the 
[Retrochallenge 2022/10 Competition](https://www.retrochallenge.org/p/entrants-list-202210.html) and probably 
subsequent challenges.

The Casio Pocket Computer range use a fairly standardized version 
of BASIC. This project is to create a parser for 
BASIC using the programming language [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
and the parser library [fastparse](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/fastparse).

I have a couple of different Casio computers - I had one when I was a kid and loved it.
Arguably the top-of-the-range model is the FX-850P. I now own one of these 
and have built a cable that allows me to download and upload files. This will allow
 me to confirm correct behaviour of the parser/interpreter.
