*A Casio Basic Project - Parser and Interpreter*

This is my entry for the 
[Retrochallenge 2022/10 Competition](https://www.retrochallenge.org/p/entrants-list-202210.html) and probably 
subsequent challenges.

The Casio Pocket Computer range use a fairly standardized version 
of BASIC called [Casio PocketPC BASIC](http://foroplus.com/basic/casiopbasic.php). This project is to create a parser for 
BASIC using the programming language [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
and the parser library [fastparse](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/fastparse).

I have a couple of different Casio computers - I had a 
[Casio PB-410](https://ithistory.org/db/hardware/casio-computer-co-ltd/casio-pb-410) when I was a kid and loved it.
Arguably the top-of-the-range model is the [FX-850P](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/20339/Casio-FX-850P/). 
I now own one of these and have built a cable that allows me to download and upload files. This will allow
 me to confirm correct behaviour of the parser/interpreter.

### General documentation is now hosted on [urbancamo.github.io](https://urbancamo.github.io/casio-pocket-computers.html)

This repository contains the code for the [Casio ASCII converter](âˆšhttps://github.com/urbancamo/casio-basic/blob/main/src/main/scala/uk/m0nom/casio/basic/converter/Converter.scala) and Parser (TODO)
